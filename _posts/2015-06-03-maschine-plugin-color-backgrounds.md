You can change the background color by editing color.db. I will write up details on this.

The file to edit
`/Users/Shared/NI Resources/_DatabaseResources/color/color.db`

`color.db` is a sqllite database. If you don't have a tool to edit it, [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) is a free download.
