## Plugin sanity!

If you have a lot of 3rd party plugins, for the sake of sanity, "organize" them in the User section. With a lot of plugins, the dropdown in the software can be **monstrously** long/unwieldy ([especially if you haven't pruned it](Some-things-I-have-learned-about-plugins)). You can access them on the controller by blah blah.

## In a nutshell

* Load up a 3rd party plugin
* In the software, right click on the plugin and select `Save As`. Idea: save it with an `_` in front of the name (e.g. `_LFO Tool`). The underscore signifies that the plugin's parameters are in a default state (and this will sort the name to the top of the list).
* Now, `Browse` with `User` selected to see a list of plugin vendors on the left screen (which can be used to hone in a specific vendor)

You can now organize your plugins in a plethora of ways

* Save only the default state of the key plugins you use
* Save the default state of every plugin you own (if you have a lot of time)
* Save plugins with custom settings

Lastly, instead of the boring default graphics above, you can make it look like this
