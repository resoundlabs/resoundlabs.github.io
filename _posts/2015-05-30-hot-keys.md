I like to keep my hands on the keyboard. To that end, I have a bunch of shortcuts for quick navigation. There are lots of apps to create hotkeys - [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), [BetterTouchTool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/), etc (I use those three for specific things in my franken'mation (better than rube'n'mation)). In my setup, [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) is key (no pun). Seil lets you remap any key to another key. There are three keys that I never/rarely use.

### Use Seil and Keyboard Maestro to setup shortcuts

#### Remap unused keys to Function Keys above F12 (OSX supports F1 thru F19, however, Mac keyboards stop at F12)

Suggestions:

`caps lock` remapped to `F19 (80)`<br>
Does anyone use this anymore? No brainer to repurpose.

`cmd_right` remapped to `F17 (64)`<br>
The ONLY time I ever used this was when I needed to hit `cmd+del` with my left hand because I had an external mouse in my right. An edge case to be sure, repurpose it!

`option_right` remapped to `F18 (79)`<br>
I can't think of any circumstance where I used this key. Likely doing nothing, repurpose it!


#### Assign shortcuts in Keyboard Maestro.
