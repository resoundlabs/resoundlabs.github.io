There are a handful of unix commands that must be mastered!!!

* `ls` and all its extensions
* `grep` especially when fed from a `|`
* `find` when you need to locate something quickly from the shell. [Good tutorial](http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufind.htm)
* `ln -s target_path link_path` you want the `s` to create a symbolic link rather than a hard one
* `scp`
*
