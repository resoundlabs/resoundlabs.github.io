I like to keep my hands on the keyboard. To that end, I have a bunch of shortcuts for quick navigation. There are lots of apps to create hotkeys - [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), [BetterTouchTool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/), etc (those three are a part of my franken'mation (better than rube'n'mation)). In my setup, [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) is key (no pun). Seil lets you remap any key to another key. There are three keys that I never/rarely use `caps lock`, `opt(left)` and `cmd(left)`. Remapping these specific keys in shortcuts means less chance of tromping over some already defined system or app specific shortcut.

#### My Shortcuts

|**hotkey** | **app**|
|---------------------|---------------|
|`capslock`| iTerm|
|`cmd(r)+capslock`| Path Finder|
|`shift+capslock`| Evernote|
|`opt(l)`| Messages|
|`cmd(l)`| Slack|
|`cmd(r)+opt(r)+space`| Sublime|


<!-- |`opt-r`| help file| -->

### Use Seil and Keyboard Maestro to setup shortcuts

#### In Seil

Remap unused keys to Function Keys above F12 (OSX supports F1 thru F19, however, Mac keyboards stop at F12)

Suggestions:

`caps lock` remapped to `F19 (80)`<br>
Does anyone use this anymore? No brainer to repurpose.

`cmd_right` remapped to `F17 (64)`<br>
The ONLY time I ever used this was when I needed to hit `cmd+del` with my left hand because I had an external mouse in my right. An edge case to be sure, repurpose it!

`option_right` remapped to `F18 (79)`<br>
I can't think of any circumstance where I used this key. Likely doing nothing, repurpose it!


#### In Keyboard Maestro

Create a macro associating a hot key with an action. Sky's the limit here. The hot key can active an app (as I have above) or any action you choose.
