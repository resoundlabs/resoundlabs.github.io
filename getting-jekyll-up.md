## Starting points

These two tutorials were hugely useful in getting started. I used Barry's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as my starting point.

* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) / [Barry Clark](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/barryclark/)
* [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) / [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/)

### Random things I have figure out in the process

* figure out a post naming strategy
* create your own style guide - ex. when to use what header size.
