The corners are a fantastic trigger. Unfortunately, the "Hot Corners" option in Prefreneces is constrained to a handful of predefined actions. Enter [CornerClick](http://gschueler.github.io/CornerClick/index.html) which allows you to take total control over your corners. The developer opensourced it in 2010, and it doesn't look like any development has occured since then. That said, I am using it in Yosemite and it is working for me. I set the trigger to `Hover` which works well.

Set actions for each corner, modify the trigger with hot keys, hover, click, etc. There a handful of predefined actions (including "Desktop" and "Screensaver" that I used with Hot Corners). In addition, there is an ApplesScript action which opens the door to trigger just about anything you can dream up.

I hope someone with inclination/spare time comes along and updates this. In addition to the corners, being able to define an active area on the side of the screen would offer additional trigger points.
