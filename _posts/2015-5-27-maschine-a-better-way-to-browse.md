## Plugin sanity!

The browser does not do a great job in facilitating browsing 3rd party plugins. If you have a lot, the dropdown in the software can be monstrously long ([especially if you haven't pruned it](Some-things-I-have-learned-about-plugins)). You can access them on the controller by blah blah. FWIW, here is what I did.

* load up a plugin
* select Save As and save it with an `_` in front of the name. The underscore signifies that it is in it's default state (and will sort at the top of the list if you have also saved some plugins with patches or custom names).
* the plugin will now show up in the "user" section. To select, click on the user button.
* you can do this for the plugins that you use all the time, or if you are really bored, you can do it for every single plugin. In any case, they are much easier to access now.
* to select a plugin, set to "user" and select by developer.

Even sexier, you can create custom graphics for each developer.
