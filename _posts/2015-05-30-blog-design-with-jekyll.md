It is really easy to try out a new "theme" for your jekyll blog. In a nutshell...

1. Copy your jekyll blog to a new directory
2. Symlink your existing `_posts` folder to the new directory (this will allow you to build with all of your existing content)
3. In the new directory, edit your configuration to your hearts content
4. `jekyll s` and check it out
