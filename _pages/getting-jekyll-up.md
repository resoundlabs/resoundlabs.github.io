title: Getting Jekyll up and running

## Starting points

These two tutorials were hugely useful in getting started. I used Barry's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as my starting point.

* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) / [Barry Clark](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/barryclark/)
* [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) / [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/)

### Random things I have figured out in the process

* figure out a post naming strategy
* create your own style guide - ex. when to use what header size.
* what is best pushing policy - how often to commit - or maybe that is why I should be doing local work and only committing when I want to publish? This becomes less of an issue when I have all the of configuration stuff tied down - its the config stuff that I really want to watch the versioning of.
* installed jekyll - `jekyll server` in a directory with `_config.yml` starts up a server (presuming a bunch of other stuf is there as well). It creates the `_site` dir which has all of the files in it. Awesome.
* this setups a workflow where you can edit docs - on save, a rebuild is done - so you can see the changes as they happen - and at any point, can commit them to the main site - which will trigger a rebuild. Here is one article that describes how to work around it - http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/
* if you include `permalink: /something/` in the frontmatter, it will take the `.md` file and render it as `something/index.html` - that means the url to access it doesn't require the `.html` extension. Then to access it, you would use the link `<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive">something</a>`. Pretty damn snify - it almost makes it look like the site was autogenerated - and the urls are rest-ish. Current setting in `_config.yml` is `permalink: /:title/`
* It is super easy to play around - simply create a new directory with new configuration stuff - in fact, one could even `symlink` the posts from another directory for testing.
* use this https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/tree/master/site for ideas - this is code behind the jekyll site.

### Things I have done

* setup a twitter link - more work to do on this (doing this required creating `twitter.html` in `_include`)
* inline graphics
* changed format of `<code>` tag
* created a file directory and put a zip file in it - can link to it from post
* discovered that `<br>` works inline in markdown files
* set up a filter on gmail account to get "build failure" messages (they come from `support@github.com`)
* added extensions line for redcarpet in `_config.yml` to support some extended options
*

### Things to do

* figure out tagging
* get a twitter icon on there
* what about facebook likes?
* create a summary of the posts that I send to myself - like to have a running list
* http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/ - use this
* trigger a rebuild - `git commit -m 'rebuild pages' --allow-empty`
* ultimately, will want to build locally and push http://blog.andrewshell.org/github-pages-gotcha/
* and here is one for scheduling http://www.1pxsolidtomato.com/2014/12/29/scheduling-posts-with-jekyll-github-pages-and-zapier/
* make the "all rights reserved in a smaller font"
* link list post - but have the full linked content searchable on local site
* oh, how do I set up site wide searching (ahh.. I think you build it when building jekyll - and then upload for searching - it becomes a little txt db?)
* add captions - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll like the `img + em {}` suggestion
* change the block at the top - and do I want it to not scroll? What about just the directory not scrolling?
* Should I move some header info to the left side? How will that effect dynamic resizing?
