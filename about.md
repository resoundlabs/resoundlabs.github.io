#  A Little Studio

I have amassed a lot of equipment over the years. Started as a hobby, grew into a full blown studio ([Trillium Lane](http://www.fmdesign.com/2013/wp-content/uploads/trillium-2.jpg)), morphed into a audio plugin business (TL Labs - sold to Digidesign - but our plugins, like [Space](https://www.avid.com/US/products/Space), live on!). Now, its back to a home studio again, but I still have a good bit of equipment.

Until I have an email form set up, if you want to ask a question or contact me, please use disqus below (less than optimal I know).
