I have amassed a lot of equipment over the years. Started as a hobby, grew into a full blown studio... Trillium Lane Studios (which was ironically/tragically turned into a horse barn)

which morphed into a audio plugin business (TL Labs - sold to Digidesign - but our plugins, like [Space](https://www.avid.com/US/products/Space), live on!).

Now, its back to a home studio again, but I still have a good bit of equipment.
